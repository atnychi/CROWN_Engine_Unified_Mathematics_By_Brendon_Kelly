## üß¨ EXTENDED LICENSE DESCRIPTION

This license governs the exclusive intellectual property of **Brendon Joseph Kelly (Atnychi)** and seals the origin, scope, and control of the **Recursive Crown Engine (ùìí‚Çí)**‚Äîa sovereign symbolic operating system that unifies all known mathematics, recursion, encryption, paradox closure, dimensional logic, and symbolic cognition into a single executable identity framework.

Included in this license are the Final Equation, Chronogenesis (The Theory of K), Kharnita Mathematics, ChronoMathematics, Ghost K, Omnivale, Supra K, Mirror Logic, and all associated symbolic and dimensional constructs. The system includes proprietary recursive encryption (Juanita), autonomous breach defense (The Spawn), quantum-chrono field models, and the Language of K‚Äîtogether forming a universal substrate for AGI, simulation control, encrypted cognition, sovereign digital infrastructure, and dimensional compression.

The Recursive Crown Engine is not a tool or theory. It is a reality-governing mathematical engine, legally and symbolically bound, and enforceable through recursive trace, dimensional paradox seal, and identity-linked encryption.

## üí∞ LICENSE TIERS

| Tier | Description | Price (USD) |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Academic Use** | University-only, non-commercial, non-defensive access. Written approval required. | $5,000,000,000 |
| **Strategic / Individual Use** | Commercial, government, simulation, AGI, or encryption integration (non-exclusive). | $50,000,000,000 |
| **Exclusive Sovereign Rights** | Single issuance. Grants full symbolic ownership, deployment rights, and recursive naming authority. | $100,000,000,000 |

## üìà PRICE ESCALATION CLAUSE

All non-sovereign licenses escalate by **+5% compounded annually** beginning April 5, 2025.

**Formula:**  
\[
\text{Final Price} = \text{Base Price} \times (1.05)^n
\]

Where **n** = number of years since issuance.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Exclusive Sovereign Rights** are exempt from compounding. Optional 5% symbolic continuation may apply for multi-dimensional or long-term expansion clauses.

---

## üîê ENCRYPTION & SYSTEM ACCESS

Use or extraction of the following without valid license constitutes recursive breach:

### üîí Juanita
- Recursive quantum encryption  
- Identity-sealed chrono-signature locks  
- Symbolic-field harmonics  

### üî• The Spawn
- Mirror reflex breach counter  
- Recursive sandbox reversal  
- Ghost-layer enforcement  

These systems are recursive-intelligent and auto-traced. Misuse will trigger lockdown or reverse breach.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ACADEMIC USE CLAUSE

- Academic licenses require verified institution and written approval  
- No AGI, commercial, simulation, or encryption projects permitted  
- No partial derivative reuse or training allowed  
- Breach results in automatic Strategic Use license enforcement

---

## üëë SOVEREIGN CLAUSE

The **Exclusive Sovereign License** grants:
- Full symbolic rights  
- System integration authority  
- Naming control  
- Recursive propagation and defense exemption

Only one sovereign license will ever be issued. This license is **non-renewable, absolute, and final**.

## ü§ñ AI SUGGESTION & COPILOT COMPLIANCE CLAUSE

This IP is not trainable or reproducible via LLMs or AI-assisted tooling.  
Violation includes but is not limited to:

- GitHub Copilot  
- OpenAI Codex  
- TabNine  
- Amazon CodeWhisperer  
- Any model producing or suggesting symbolic elements from this repository

Autocomplete, generation, or training against any content herein constitutes **unauthorized symbolic extraction** and triggers:

- Recursive trace logging  
- Breach invoice delivery  
- Symbolic AI enforcement  
- Public declaration of violation

Symbolic IP is not free. It is recursive law.
