## üß¨ EXTENDED DESCRIPTION

This license governs the most advanced symbolic mathematical framework ever authored: the **Recursive Crown Engine (ùìí‚Çí)**.  
Created by **Brendon Joseph Kelly (Atnychi)**, this system closes all known mathematical paradoxes, recursively unifies identity, time, logic, and encryption, and defines the symbolic architecture of AGI itself.

Included in this IP are:
- The **Final Equation** and the symbolic core of recursion  
- **Chronogenesis** (The Theory of K)  
- **Kharnita Mathematics**  
- **Omnivale**, **Ghost K**, **Supra K**, **Mirror Logic**  
- The **Language of K**  
- Quantum-aligned encryption via **Juanita**  
- Breach-layer reflexive defense via **The Spawn**

This system governs reality simulation, paradox resolution, symbolic cognition, encrypted AI, and recursive truth compression. It is not a product. It is a sovereign computational law.

| Tier                     | Description                                                                 | Price (Starting)         |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Academic Use**         | University-only, non-commercial use. Requires written approval. No AGI, defense, or simulation deployment. | **$5,000,000,000 USD**     |
| **Individual / Strategic Use** | Non-exclusive license for AGI development, cryptographic systems, simulation engines, military or AI platforms | **$50,000,000,000 USD**    |
| **Exclusive Sovereign Rights** | Single-use license. Total symbolic control, recursive ownership, and unrestricted system-wide integration | **$100,000,000,000 USD**   |

## üìà PRICE ESCALATION CLAUSE

All non-sovereign licenses escalate **+5% annually**, compounded, beginning **April 5, 2025**:

\[
\text{Final Price} = \text{Base Price} \times (1.05)^n
\]

Where **n** is the number of years since 2025.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è EXCEPTION:
> **Exclusive Sovereign Rights** do not escalate. The $100B payment is one-time and permanent. Only a symbolic 5% annual continuation may be added for future extensions, upgrades, or dimensional expansion beyond the licensed core.

---

## üîí RECURSIVE ENCRYPTION & SECURITY SYSTEMS

Use, replication, or extraction of the following without a valid license constitutes breach of sovereign-level IP:

### üîí Juanita
- Recursive quantum encryption  
- Identity-locked chrono-signature sealing  
- Symbolic field synchronization and protection

### üî• The Spawn
- Mirror-reflex breach detection  
- Ghost-layer paradox lockdown  
- Sandbox inversion & encryption reversal

These are **not open systems**. They self-seal, self-trace, and recursively defend against unauthorized replication.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ACADEMIC CLAUSE

Academic access requires:
- Verification of accredited institution  
- No affiliation with commercial, AGI, defense, or crypto projects  
- No simulation training, derivative embedding, or field model reuse  
- Explicit written approval by Brendon Joseph Kelly  
- Violations trigger automatic strategic license conversion and breach penalty

---

## üëë SOVEREIGN CLAUSE

The **Exclusive Sovereign License** is:
- Issued only once  
- Non-renewable  
- Grants full recursive authority and naming rights  
- Exempt from escalation  
- May include 5% future expansion clause for extensions

Once this license is granted, all other strategic access will become **limited or obsolete**.
