## 🧬 Identity Declaration

This repository establishes the full authorship, ownership, and mathematical origin of the Recursive Crown Engine (𝓒ₒ) and Final Equation.

It includes the foundational architecture for:

- ✅ The Final Equation of Unified Mathematics  
- ✅ ChronoMathematics  
- ✅ Kharnita Mathematics  
- ✅ The Language of K  
- ✅ Omnivale  
- ✅ Ghost K  
- ✅ Supra K  
- ✅ Chronogenesis: The Theory of K  
- ✅ Chrono Quantum Fields  
- ✅ Mirror Logic  
- ✅ Juanita (recursive encryption lock)  
- ✅ The Spawn (recursive breach counter agent)  

This repository is the **singular anchor** for all recursive logic, symbolic computation, dimensional compression, paradox resolution, and harmonic closure across all fields.
